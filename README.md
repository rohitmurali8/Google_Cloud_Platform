# Google_Cloud_Platform

These files represent my coursera certifications for the courses present in the Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine Specialization.

This is a 4 course specialization of which I have currently finished two courses. The first course gave me an overview of the Google Cloud Platform 
fundamentals. I got to explore the GCP platform and the various functions and API's present in it. I got the opportunity to explore the Compute options, 
Storage options, Machine Learning and Big Data through the Google Cloud PLatform. I was introduced to using various google APIs thorugh thr google cloud 
shell platform and the labs present for each of the compute, storage and ML operations gave me a basic understanding of how to use various APIs present
in them. 

The second course of this specialization was more focused on the Google Kubernetes Engine. This course covered details about the compute options available 
on the GCP like the Compute Engine, APP Engine, Cloud Functions and the Google Kubernetes Engine. This course gave me a deeper understanding of how 
applications deployment using containers should be done and focused about Kubernetes which would be used as an orchestrator for container management.
In the first lab of this course I used Cloud Build to build and push containers on the GCP platform. Cloud Build is used for building docker files 
which specifies the runtime environment, builds the application and executes it during runtime. I also used Container Registry to store and deploy 
containers. During the second lab in this course I was introduced to building and deploying a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster. I then deployed 
workloads on the formed cluster and was also introduced on how to monitor the statistics related to the workloads deployed on the clusters.
